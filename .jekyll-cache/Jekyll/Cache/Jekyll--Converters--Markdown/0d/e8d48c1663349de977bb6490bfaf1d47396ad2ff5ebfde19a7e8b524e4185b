I"<p><strong>Background:</strong> Suppose we are interested in computing the distance between two vertices in a graph. Under edge or node differential privacy, this problem is not promising because the removal of a single edge can make distances change from 1 to \(n − 1\) or can even disconnect the graph. However, a different setting that makes sense to consider is that of a weighted graph \((G, w)\) whose topology \(G = (V, E)\) is publicly known but edge weight function \(w : E \to \mathbb{R}^+\) must be kept private. (For instance, consider transit times on a road network. The topology of the road network may be publicly available as a map, but the edge weights corresponding to transit times may be based on private GPS locations of individual cars.)</p>

<p>Suppose that two weight functions \(w\) and \(w’\) of the same graph \(G\) are considered to be neighbors if they differ by at most 1 in \(\ell^1\) norm. Then the length of any fixed path is sensitivity-one, so the distance between any pair of vertices is also sensitivity-one and can be released privately via the Laplace mechanism. But what if we want to release all \(\Theta(n^2)\) distances between all pairs of vertices in \(G\)? We can do this with accuracy roughly \(O(n \log n )/\varepsilon\) by adding noise to each edge, or roughly \(O(n \sqrt{\log(1/\delta)}/\varepsilon)\) using composition theorems. Both of these are roughly \(n/\varepsilon\). But is this linear dependence on \(n\) inherent, or is it possible to release all-pairs distances with error sublinear in \(n\)?</p>

<p>This setting and question were considered in [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.04631">S16</a>].</p>

<p><strong>Problem 1:</strong> Let \(G\) be an arbitrary public graph, and \(w : E \to \mathbb{R}^+\) be an edge weight function. Can we release approximate all-pairs distances in \((G, w)\) with accuracy sublinear in \(n\) while preserving the privacy of the edge weight function, where two weight functions \(w, w’\) are neighbors if \(\|w − w’\|_1 \le 1\)? Or can we show that any private algorithm must have error \(\Omega(n)\)? A weaker (but nontrivial) lower bound would also be nice.</p>

<p><strong>Other related work:</strong> [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.04631">S16</a>] provided algorithms with better error for two special cases, trees and graphs of a priori bounded weight. For trees, it is possible to release all-pairs distances with error roughly \(O(\log^{1.5} n)/\varepsilon\), while for arbitrary graphs with edge weights restricted to the interval \([0,M]\), it is possible to release all-pairs distances with error roughly \(O( \sqrt{nM\varepsilon^{-1}\log(1/\delta)})\)</p>
