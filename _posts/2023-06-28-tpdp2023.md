The [9th Workshop on the Theory and Practice of Differential Privacy (TPDP 2023)](https://tpdp.journalprivacyconfidentiality.org/2023/) will take place in Boston September 27-28, 2023.
This is the first year the workshop is a standalone event. However, the [OpenDP community meeting](https://opendp.org/event/opendp-community-meeting-2023) is the following day (also in Boston). It is also moving from a one-day event to two days.

The workshop is intended to bring together the DP research community to discuss new developments over the past year. The workshop is non-archival, so does not preclude publishing the work elsewhere.

The submission deadline is July 7. Submissions should be 4 pages (plus references and appendices.)
