Most differentially private algorithms fail with some nonzero probability. For example, when adding Gaussian or Laplace noise, there is some chance that the noise deviates significantly from its mean. But, fortunately, large deviations are unlikely.
In this post we're going to take a closer look at failure modes of DP algorithms and we'll present some generic methods for reducing -- or even eliminating -- the failure probability.

Let's be precise about what we mean by failure probability:
Let's assume we have a \\\(\(\\varepsilon,\\delta\)\\\)-differentally private algorithm \\\(M : \\mathcal{X}^n \\to \\mathcal{Y}\\\) and we have a loss function \\\(\\ell : \\mathcal{Y} \\times \\mathcal{X}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}\\\).
The (worst-case) _failure probability_ \\\(\\beta\\\) of \\\(M\\\) is \\\[\\beta := \\sup\_{x\\in\\mathcal{X}^n} \\mathbb{P}\[\ell\(M\(x\),x\)&gt;\\alpha\],\\tag{1}\\\] where \\\(\\alpha\\\) is some target value for the loss.[^1]

For example, if \\\(M\(x\)=q\(x\)+\\mathsf{Laplace}\(1/\\varepsilon\)\\\) is the Laplace mechanism and \\\(\\ell\(y,x\)=\|y-q\(x\)\|\\\) is the absolute error, then \\\(\\beta = \\exp\(-\\varepsilon\\alpha\)\\\).

To be clear, in this post we're talking about failures of _utility_, which are different from failures of _privacy_.
In [a previous post](/flavoursofdelta/), we talked about privacy failures; roughly, the \\\(\\delta\\\) in \\\(\(\\varepsilon,\\delta\)\\\)-DP captures the probability of a privacy failure. Privacy failures are a lot harder to fix than utility failures (which is kinda the point of this post). 

Here's our problem: We're given a DP algorithm \\\(M\\\) with failure probability \\\(\\beta\\\), and we want to modify the algorithm to get a new DP algorithm \\\(\\widetilde{M}\\\) with failure probability \\\(\\widetilde{\\beta}&lt;\\beta\\\).

[^1]: For simplicity, in this post we will talk about failure as a boolean event; i.e., there is a hard utility threshold at \\\(\\alpha\\\). Of course, in most cases, there is not a hard threshold and it makes sense to talk about the tail probability \\\(\\beta\\\) as a function of the threshold \\\(\\alpha\\\), rather than a single value.
