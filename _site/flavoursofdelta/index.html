  <h1>What is Œ¥, and what Œ¥ifference does it make?</h1>

  <div class="entry">
    <p>There are many variants or flavours of differential privacy (DP) some weaker than others: often, a given variant comes with own guarantees and ‚Äúconversion theorems‚Äù to the others. As an example, ‚Äúpure‚Äù DP has a single parameter \(\varepsilon\), and corresponds to a very stringent notion of DP:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An algorithm \(M\) is \(\varepsilon\)-DP if, for all neighbouring inputs \(D,D'\) and all measurable \(S\), \( \Pr[ M(D) \in S ] \leq e^\varepsilon\Pr[ M(D‚Äô) \in S ] \).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By relaxing this a little, one obtains the standard definition of approximate DP, a.k.a. \((\varepsilon,\delta)\)-DP:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An algorithm \(M\) is \((\varepsilon,\delta)\)-DP if, for all neighbouring inputs \(D,D'\) and all measurable \(S\), \( \Pr[ M(D) \in S ] \leq e^\varepsilon\Pr[ M(D‚Äô) \in S ]+\delta \).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This definition is very useful, as in many settings achieving the stronger \(\varepsilon\)-DP guarantee (i.e., \(\delta=0\)) is impossible, or comes at a very high utility cost. But how to interpret it? The above definition, on its face, doesn‚Äôt preclude what one may call ‚Äú<em>catastrophic failures of privacy</em> üí•:‚Äù most of the time, things are great, but with some small probability \(\delta\) all hell breaks loose. For instance, the following algorithm is \((\varepsilon,\delta)\)-DP:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Get a sensitive database \(D\) of \(n\) records</li>
  <li>Select uniformly at random a fraction \(\delta\) of the database (\(\delta n\) records)</li>
  <li>Output that subset of records in the clear üí•</li>
</ul>

<p>(actually, this is even \((0,\delta)\)-DP!). This sounds preposterous, and obviously something that one would want to avoid in practice (lest one wants to face very angry customers or constituents). This is one of the rules of thumb for picking \(\delta\) small enough (or even ‚Äúcryptographically small‚Äù), typically \(\delta \ll 1/n\), so that the records are safe (hard to disclose \(\delta n \ll 1\) records).</p>

<p>So: good privacy most of the time, but with probably \(\delta\) then all bets are off.</p>

<p>However, those catastrophic failure of privacy, while technically allowed by the definition of \((\varepsilon,\delta)\)-DP, <strong>are not something that can really happen with the DP algorithms and techniques used both in practice and in theoretical work.</strong> Before explaining why, let‚Äôs see what is the kind of desirable behaviour one would expect: a <em>‚Äúsmooth, manageable tradeoff of privacy parameters.‚Äù</em> For that discussion, let‚Äôs introduce the <em>privacy loss random variable</em>: given an algorithm M and two neighbouring inputs D,D‚Äô, let \(f(y)\) be defined as
\[
	f(y) = \log\frac{\Pr[M(D)=y]}{\Pr[M(D‚Äô)=y]}
\]
for every possible output \(y\in\Omega\). Now, define the random variable \(Z := f(M(D))\) (implicitly, \(Z\) depends on \(D,D',M\)). This random variable quantifies how much observing the output of the algorithm \(M\) helps distinguishing between \(D\) and \(D'\).</p>

<p>Now, going a little bit fast, you can check that saying that \(M\) is \(\varepsilon\)-DP corresponds to the guarantee ‚Äú<em>\(\Pr[Z &gt; \varepsilon] = 0\) for all neighbouring inputs \(D,D'\).</em>‚Äù
Similarly, \(M\) being \((\varepsilon,\delta)\)-DP is the guarantee \(\Pr[Z &gt; \varepsilon] \leq \delta\).\({}^{(\dagger)}\) For instance, the ‚Äúcatastrophic failure of privacy‚Äù corresponds to the scenario below, which depicts a possible distribution for \(Z\): \(Z\leq \varepsilon\) with probability \(1-\delta\), but then with probability \(\delta\) we have \(Z\gg 1\).</p>

<p><img src="/images/flavours-delta-fig1.png" width="600" alt="The type of (bad) distribution of Z corresponding to 'our catastrophic failure of privacy'" style="margin:auto;display: block;" /></p>

<p>What we would like is a smoother thing, where even when \(Z&gt;\varepsilon\) is still remains reasonable and doesn‚Äôt immediately become large. A nice behaviour of the tails, ideally something like this:</p>

<p><img src="/images/flavours-delta-fig2.png" width="600" alt="A distribution for Z with nice tails, leading to smooth tradeoffs between Œµ and Œ¥" style="margin:auto;display: block;" /></p>

<p>For instance, if we had a bound on \(\mathbb{E}[|Z|]\), we could use Markov‚Äôs inequality to get, well, <em>something</em>. For instance, imagine we had \(\mathbb{E}[|Z|]\leq \varepsilon\delta\): then 
\[
	\Pr[ |Z| &gt; \varepsilon ] \leq \frac{\mathbb{E}[|Z|]}{\varepsilon }\leq \delta
\]
<em>(great! We have \((\varepsilon,\delta)\)-DP)</em>; but also  \(\Pr[ |Z| &gt; 10\varepsilon ] \leq \frac{\delta}{10}\). Privacy violations do not blow up out of proporxtion immediately, we can trade \(\varepsilon\) for \(\delta\). That seems like the type of behaviour we would like our algorithms to exhibit.</p>

<p><img src="/images/flavours-delta-fig3.png" width="600" alt="The type of privacy guarantees a Markov-type tail bound would give" style="margin:auto;display: block;" /></p>

<p>But why stop at Markov‚Äôs inequality then, which gives some nice but still weak tail bounds? Why not ask for <em>stronger</em>: Chebyshev‚Äôs inequality? Subexponential tail bounds? Hell, <em>subgaussian</em> tail bounds? This is, basically, what some stronger notions of differential privacy than approximate DP give.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>R√©nyi DP</strong> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.07476" title="Ilya Mironov. Renyi Differential Privacy. CSF 2017"><strong>[Mironov17]</strong></a>, for instance, is a guarantee on the moment-generating function (MGF) of the privacy random variable \(Z\): it has two parameters, \(\alpha&gt;1\) and \(\tau\), and requires that \(\mathbb{E}[e^{(\alpha-1)Z}] \leq e^{(\alpha-1)\tau}\) for all neighbouring \(D,D'\). In turn, by applying for instance Markov‚Äôs inequality to the MGF of \(Z\), we can control the tail bounds, and get a nice, smooth tradeoff in terms of \((\varepsilon,\delta)\)-DP.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Concentrated DP</strong> (CDP)  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.02065" title="Mark Bun and Thomas Steinke. Concentrated Differential Privacy: Simplifications, Extensions, and Lower Bounds. TCC 2016"><strong>[BS16]</strong></a> is an even stronger requirement, which roughly speaking requires the algorithm to be R√©nyi DP <em>simultaneously</em> for all \(1&lt; \alpha \leq \infty\). More simply, this is ‚Äúmorally‚Äù a requirement on the MGF of \(Z\) which asks it to be subgaussian.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The above two examples are not just fun but weird variants of DP: they actually capture the behaviour of many well-known differentially private algorithms, and in particular that of the Gaussian mechanism. While the guarantees they provide are less easy to state and interpret than \(\varepsilon\)-DP or \((\varepsilon,\delta)\)-DP, they are incredibly useful to analyze those algorithms, and enjoy very nice composition properties‚Ä¶ and, of course, lead to that smooth tradeoff between \(\varepsilon\) and \(\delta\) for \((\varepsilon,\delta)\)-DP.</p>

<p><strong>To summarize:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>\(\varepsilon\)-DP gives great guarantees, but is a very stringent requirement. Corresponds to the privacy loss random variable supported on \([-\varepsilon,\varepsilon]\) (no tails!)</li>
  <li>\((\varepsilon,\delta)\)-DP gives guarantees easy to parse, but on its face allows for very bad behaviours. Corresponds to the privacy loss random variable in \([-\varepsilon,\varepsilon]\) with probability \(1-\delta\) (but outside, all bets are off!)</li>
  <li>R√©nyi DP and Concentrated DP correspond to something in between, controlling the tails of the privacy loss random variable by a guarantee on its MGF. A bit harder to interpret, but capture the behaviour of many DP building blocks can be converted to \((\varepsilon,\delta)\)-DP (with nice trade-offs between \(\varepsilon\) and \(\delta\).</li>
</ul>

<hr />
<p>\({}^{(\dagger)}\) The astute reader may notice that this is not <em>quite</em> true. Namely, the guarantee \(\Pr[Z &gt; \varepsilon] \leq \delta\) on the privacy loss random variable (PLRV) does imply \((\varepsilon,\delta)\)-differential privacy, but the converse does not hold. See, for instance, Lemma 9 of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00010" title="Cl√©ment L. Canonne, Gautam Kamath, Thomas Steinke. The Discrete Gaussian for Differential Privacy. NeurIPS 2020"><strong>[CKS20]</strong></a> for an exact characterization of \((\varepsilon,\delta)\)-DP in terms of the PLRV.</p>
